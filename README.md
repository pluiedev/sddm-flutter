# sddm-flutter

A repo containing the [Flutter SDDM theme](https://store.kde.org/p/1323348/) made by @adhec.

For some reason, the linked files and repos don't contain this theme anywhere, nor is this
theme uploaded anywhere on the internet.

For the sake of convenience to myself and potentially to other people, I've reuploaded it
in this repo for easier installs with automated tooling that has an easier time working with
Git repos than trying to download from the KDE Store. (And like, it's CC-BY-SA anyway.
I'm not breaking rules here)
